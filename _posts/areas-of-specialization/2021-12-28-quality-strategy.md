Testing is a critical part of any organizationâ€™s success. However, the approach  is typically to start testing after the development is done with the objective of finding defects in the development.

This is one of the main reasons why Testing becomes a bottle-neck for your organization. To add to the problem, because it is done so late in the SDLC, the cost of fixing issues found at this stage is huge.

We need to stop testing for quality, and instead focus on building a good quality product in the first place.

I work with stakeholders to create a vision of Quality and build a strategy for building a quality product, inside-out.

This often includes the following activities:
> Assessment to understand the current state of the product quality. The assessment is necessary to uncover the differences in perceived state of quality Vs actual state.

> Test Strategy - Based on the assessment, create a shared understanding of the vision of Quality, and create a plan how to build a quality product.

> Test Case Management - While writing test cases in a Test Case Management is valuable, you need to have relevant details associated with the test cases. Also, the test cases need to be structured in a way that will make them an asset for further use, and not just "part of a process".

> Test Automation - This is a key pillar to build a quality product, and not taking forever to do that. We need fast feedback, and automation is the key. I will help identify the layers of the Test Automation Pyramid, and suggest tools and technologies to help in the same.

> Test Execution - This is the most important pillar of the Test Automation Pyramid. We need to execute the tests, and make sure that the tests are executed in a timely manner.

> Test Reporting - This is the last pillar of the Test Automation Pyramid. We need to report the results of the tests, and make sure that the results are reported in a timely manner.

> Test Data Management - This is the last pillar of the Test Automation Pyramid. We need to manage the tests, and make sure that the tests are managed in a timely manner.
