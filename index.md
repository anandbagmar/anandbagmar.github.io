# Areas of Specialization

##Quality  Strategy
Testing is a critical part of any organization’s success. However, the approach to testing is typically testing after the development is done.
This is one of the main reasons why Testing becomes a bottle-neck for your organization. To add to the problem, because it is done later in the SDLC, the cost of fixing issues found at this sate is huge.

We need to stop testing for quality, and instead focus on building a good quality product in the first place.

I work with stakeholders to create a vision of Quality and build a strategy for building a quality product, inside-out.

This often includes the following activities:
* Assessment - to understand the current state of the product quality. The assessment is necessary to uncover the differences in perceived state of quality Vs actual state.
* Proposal - Based on the assessment, and the shared understanding of the vision of Quality, create a plan how to build a quality product.
* Test Automation - This is a key pillar to build a quality product, and not taking forever to do that. We need fast feedback, and automation is the key. I will help identify the layers of the Test Automation Pyramid, and suggest tools and technologies to help in the same.
* Test Execution - This is the most important pillar of the Test Automation Pyramid. We need to execute the tests, and make sure that the tests are executed in a timely manner.
* Test Reporting - This is the last pillar of the Test Automation Pyramid. We need to report the results of the tests, and make sure that the results are reported in a timely manner.
* Test Data Management - This is the last pillar of the Test Automation Pyramid. We need to manage the tests, and make sure that the tests are managed in a timely manner.
* Test Case Management
* Feedback loop - Analytics
* Visual Testing
