## **Working together to build a Quality Product, Inside-Out!**

# Introduction
I am **Anand Bagmar**. I am a **Software Quality Evangelist** with 20+ years in the software testing field. I am passionate about shipping a quality product, and specializes in Product Quality strategy & execution, and also building automated testing tools, infrastructure and frameworks.

I am a contributor on the Selenium project, writes testing related blogs and has built open-source tools related to Software Testing – WAAT (Web Analytics Automation Testing Framework), TaaS (for automating the integration testing in disparate systems) and TTA (Test Trend Analyzer).

# Areas of Specialization

## Quality  Strategy
Testing is a critical part of any organization’s success. However, the approach  is typically to start testing after the development is done with the objective of finding defects in the development.

This is one of the main reasons why Testing becomes a bottle-neck for your organization. To add to the problem, because it is done so late in the SDLC, the cost of fixing issues found at this stage is huge.

We need to stop testing for quality, and instead focus on building a good quality product in the first place.

I work with stakeholders to create a vision of Quality and build a strategy for building a quality product, inside-out.

This often includes the following activities:
* Assessment - to understand the current state of the product quality. The assessment is necessary to uncover the differences in perceived state of quality Vs actual state.
* Test Strategy - Based on the assessment, create a shared understanding of the vision of Quality, and create a plan how to build a quality product.
* Test Case Management - While writing test cases in a Test Case Management is valuable, you need to have relevant details associated with the test cases. Also, the test cases need to be structured in a way that will make them an asset for further use, and not just "part of a process".
* Test Automation - This is a key pillar to build a quality product, and not taking forever to do that. We need fast feedback, and automation is the key. I will help identify the layers of the Test Automation Pyramid, and suggest tools and technologies to help in the same.
* Test Execution - This is the most important pillar of the Test Automation Pyramid. We need to execute the tests, and make sure that the tests are executed in a timely manner.
* Test Reporting - This is the last pillar of the Test Automation Pyramid. We need to report the results of the tests, and make sure that the results are reported in a timely manner.
* Test Data Management - This is the last pillar of the Test Automation Pyramid. We need to manage the tests, and make sure that the tests are managed in a timely manner.
* Feedback loop - Analytics
* Visual Testing using Applitools Visual AI

## Test Automation
Building Test Automation Framework is easy - to start with. But as the number of automated tests increase, it becomes increasingly complicated and painful to keep your Test Automation as performant.

There are many criteria you think about when building a Test Automation Framework. Over the years, I have come to realise these can be grouped as non-negotiable and negotiable criteria.

Based on your context, I will help you create the right Test Automation Strategy, and help you build a Test Automation Framework. I will enable your team to understand the thought process, and mentor them to scale this framework to their needs.
